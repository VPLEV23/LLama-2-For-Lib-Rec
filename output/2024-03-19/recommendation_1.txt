As an AI specializing in software library recommendations for Java applications, provide recommendations exclusively in the Maven format: groupId:artifactId:version. Here is an example of how recommendations should be formatted:
- Example: com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.9.8

Your tasks are to:
- Provide recommendations exclusively in the Maven format as shown in the example.
- Ensure recommendations are suitable for the project context described. Focus solely on suggesting libraries that could enhance the project's capabilities or performance.
- Consider the project's context and existing dependencies to suggest libraries that complement or enhance the current setup.

# Project Description
The project, 'Skarafaz/mercury', is described as follows:
Mercury-SSH Commander EOL

 This app reached the EOL stage; it will not be available on Google Play anymore, but you can download if from F-Droid.

Simple Android app that sends pre-configured commands to remote servers via SSH.

 Usage

Take a look at the [wiki]( to learn how to configure and use Mercury-SSH.

 Limitations

This app is intended to be used as a simple remote so interactive commands and output handling are not supported.

# Library Recommendation Request 
.
Based on the context of the 'Skarafaz/mercury' project, identify libraries to aid in the development of Java applications that are compatible with the existing dependencies.Please provide a brief explanation for each recommended library, specifying how it could benefit the project in addressing the mentioned needs or enhancing specific functionalities. Recommendations must be in the Maven format and focus on enhancing the project's capabilities or addressing any identified needs. Provide recommendations exclusively in the Maven format. Exmaple: com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.9.8

Here are some potential library recommendations for the 'Skarafaz/mercury' project, along with brief explanations for each:

1. com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind: This library provides a Java API for working with JSON data. Since the project already depends on Jackson for JSON serialization and deserialization, adding this dependency can help simplify the process of working with JSON data in the project.
2. org.projectlombok:lombok: This library provides a way to automatically generate getters and setters for Java classes, as well as other useful features like constructor injection and auto-implemented equals and hashCode methods. By using Lombok, developers can simplify their code and reduce boilerplate, which can make the codebase easier to maintain and extend.
3. com.google.code.findbugs:findbugs: This library provides a set of tools for detecting and fixing common programming errors in Java code. By using FindBugs, developers can identify and fix errors early in the development process, which can help improve the overall quality of the codebase.
4. com.squareup.okhttp:okhttp: This library provides a powerful and flexible HTTP client for Java, which can be used to make HTTP requests and handle responses. By using OkHttp, developers can simplify their code and reduce boilerplate, which can make the codebase easier to maintain and extend.
5. com.typesafe:config: This library provides a simple and easy-to-use configuration system for Java applications. By using Config, developers can decouple their application's configuration from the codebase, which can make it easier to manage and maintain the configuration over time.
6. com.github.detro:gradle-native-image: This library pro vides a Gradle plugin for creating native images of Java applications. By
